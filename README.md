This little tool is an experimental enshrouded server manager.

Every Server Profile has its own install directory and configuration.
You are able to make backups (.zip) of your worldsave files for each server.

Windowname of the server applications should be named as follow:
ESM Server - "Servername"

Important: 
If you delete a profile, it is your own responsibility to save the backups and/or worldsave before (for example on the desktop), as these will be lost when you delete a profile.

Cant give any support because of time issues.

Use at own risk!
